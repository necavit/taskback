**taskback** is a simple MEAN stack platform to manage personal TODO and task lists.

### But... Why?

There are tons of apps and services to manage TODO lists, tasks and information lists. I know that. I use some of them, but none have proven to be flexible and light-weight enough for my needs. Besides, no task management service or app supports [Gingerbread](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html#Platform) anymore, even though we are still quite a lot of users out there, so this is a way to keep my device running this kind of application.

And it is indeed for fun. And learning, mostly learning.
